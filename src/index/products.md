## Hellō B2B SSO  
### Zero configuration enterprise SSO

Enable enterprise SSO without any setup or configuration. Users simply enter their work email, and Hellō automatically routes them to their company's email provider (Microsoft, Google, Zoho, etc.), which handles authentication through their corporate SSO. The first user from a company helps establish branding, then subsequent users enjoy a seamless, branded login experience. No SAML configuration, no IT tickets, no waiting—it just works.

## Hellō Lifecycle
### Add offboarding to your B2B app

Automate user deprovisioning for your B2B SaaS application. Your customers' tenant admins connect their corporate directory (Microsoft Entra, Google Workspace, etc.) through Hellō. When an employee is deprovisioned in their directory, Hellō automatically notifies your application via OpenID Provider Command, allowing you to suspend or remove access immediately. Give your enterprise customers the automated offboarding they expect.

## GitHub Offboarding
### Simplify & automate compliance

Solve GitHub access management for your own organization. Hellō guides each GitHub org member through linking their personal GitHub account with their corporate identity in a custom repository. Connect your corporate directory, and when an employee is deprovisioned, their GitHub org access is automatically removed. See how Hellō Lifecycle works while solving a real compliance gap for your team.
