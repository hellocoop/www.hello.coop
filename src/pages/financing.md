# The Hellō Financing Model

## Raising Capital as a Cooperative
Our financing model is based on revenue sharing.

We've chosen this approach because getting seed funding from our members isn’t feasible at the scale of funding we need and – as a cooperative – a traditional exchange of equity for capital isn’t possible.

## Revenue Sharing Based on the Rule of 40
We’re adapting the Rule of 40 – a popular business performance metric – to determine how much revenue to set aside in a given year. 

In years where we grow less than 40%, we’ll share up to 40% of our revenue with investors. The exact percentage for a given year will be 40% minus the annualized growth rate for that year. eg. If we grow 20% in 2025, then 20% of our revenue would be returned to investors. As Hellō is operated on a cost-recovery basis, if there’s profit after this, then any overage will be used to improve Hellō and may indicate a need to reduce fees.

This approach balances revenue sharing appropriately with growth. It also provides transparency on the returns on investing in Hellō, with investors receiving returns comparable to other SaaS investments. Years where we grow quickly build value for our investors and years with slower growth give investors the option for direct returns.

## How Revenue Sharing Works
Revenue sharing is administered with a modern smart-contract approach called a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). 

Investors and other early contributors to Hellō’s success are given Hellō DAO tokens in exchange for their investment of money and time.

Tokens generate an equal amount of coins on a monthly basis. These coins can be exchanged for a portion of revenue, additional tokens, or used as credit against account fees. Additionally, tokens provide holders with management and decision-making rights in the DAO.

## Long-term Sustainability

While the DAO lets us get going, our long-term financial stability comes from charging a tiny fee – pennies – to developers when one of their apps requests verified identity data about Hellō user. eg. You sign up for a new app and the app developer wants to ensure that you are 19 or older. We’ll release a verified claim that asserts if you are (or are not) 19 and charge the app developer a few pennies. It’s a tiny fee but, scaled to billions of requests, it’s more than enough to cover the costs of running a resilient service.
