# Smart Contract Financing

Building and launching a global, always-available cloud service requires significant capital, and we are competing with other SaaS startups for venture funds. 

## Competitive ROI

The Rule of 40 is a common metric investors use today to determine if a SaaS business is successful. As a cooperative, we do not have equity to offer investors, but we can use the Rule of 40 to create an explicit ROI that is competitive.

When annualized growth is below 40%, investors will receive 40% of Hellō interchange revenue less the annualized growth rate.

## Smart Contracts

Rather than receiving equity, investors will receive tokens where their rights will be encoded in a smart contract rather than a shareholder agreement. Tokens will also be used to incentivise employees and reward early adopters of Hellō.
## FAQs
### 1) What is the Rule of 40?
The [Rule of 40][1] was popularized by Brad Feld and states that a company's annual revenue growth rate plus annual profit margin should be 40%. While there is controversy on how applicable the Rule of 40 is to early stage companies, it is simple to understand and is a popular metric for measuring SaaS companies that enables Hellō to offer returns comparable to other SaaS venture opportunities.
### 2) How would the Rule of 40 work in practice?
If the Hellō interchange generates revenue of $125M in a quarter, and a year earlier generated revenue of $100M in the same quarter, the annualized growth rate, ($125 - $100M) / $100M, would be 25%. Per the Rule of 40, 15% (40% - 25%) of revenue, $18.75M (15% * $125M), would be distributed to investors.
### 3) Why is Hellō using the Rule of 40?
We want to provide investors a return competitive with comparable investments. Fixing the return as a function of growth and revenue aligns the interests of all stakeholders on growing revenue in contrast to a traditional corporation that is maximizing shareholder value. 
### 4) What other financing methods did you explore?
We initially explored a revenue-based financing model similar to [toll revenue bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tollrevenuebond.asp) used to finance public projects such as bridges and roads, where investors receive a percentage of revenue over a period of time. This model works well for projects that have predictable capital requirements and predictable revenue where there is one round of financing, and Hellō is not such a project.
### 5) What if there’s a profit?
We will reduce our interchange fees so that we are only charging what is needed to cover expenses.
### 6) Why does the Rule of 40 only apply to interchange revenue?
Hellō receives membership fees from corporate members that are independent of the interchange fees. We use the member fees to cover cooperative expenses unrelated to building and operating the interchange and that the interchange revenue should not cover, and similarly it is not appropriate for investors to get a return on the membership fees.  
### 7) How will investors and employees sell their tokens?
We will either run a regular auction that matches buyers and sellers of tokens via the smart contract, or list the Hellō tokens on a token exchange. 

### 8) Why are you rewarding early adopters with token credits?
Early adopters are taking a risk when they integrate an unfamiliar and novel service that their application is dependent on for identity. These application developers are helping build the network as most users of their applications will be new-to-Hellō. Based on the number of the new-to-Hellō users they bring us, we will reward them with tokens that can be used as credits against their Hellō account.
### 9) How will Hellō compete for talent without stock options?
We will offer employees restricted token units (RTUs) that vest over a period of years similar to stock option and restricted stock unit vesting schedules offered by other technology companies. 
### 10) What is a smart contract?
A smart contract is a contract whose terms are recorded in a computer language instead of legal language. Smart contracts can be automatically executed by a computing system, such as a distributed ledger system. Smart contracts allow transactions to be carried out among disparate parties without the need for a central authority or external enforcement mechanism.
### 11) Why is Hellō using smart contracts?
Smart contracts represented as tokens on a blockchain lower the costs and friction for Hellō to reward early adopters of Hellō, and for those early adopters to transfer their reward if desired. Smart contracts provide transparency for the rights of token holders, and ensures all token holders are treated equally. 
Smart contracts allow Hellō to only accept tokens as compensation for Hellō services. This allows Hellō to avoid the costs and complexity of a payment system when dealing directly with developers, and only using fiat currency with Hellō resellers.
Using tokens as credits for using Hellō expands the market for tokens to Hellō customers in addition to Hellō investors, increasing the liquidity of the tokens.
### 12) Are the holders of these tokens a decentralized autonomous organization [(DAO)][2]?
Yes. In contrast to most projects that use a DAO as the governance mechanism for a project, the DAO created by the Hellō tokens will be limited to matters directly impacting the investment. Governance of Hellō will be by a multi-stakeholder cooperative that provides democratic representation from all stakeholders.
