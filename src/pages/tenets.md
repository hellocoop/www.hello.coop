# Hellō Tenets

## Why do we have tenets?
Our tenets guide us in making decisions. When we are choosing between two courses of action, the one that aligns with our tenets will be the one we choose.

## 1. The Laws of Identity
Kim Cameron’s “Laws of Identity” provide strong guidance on building digital identity systems. For details, read “[Hellō and the Laws of Identity](laws-of-identity)”.

## 2. Be a Neutral Platform
The Hellō service may be used by anyone in any way that is compliant with the Laws of Identity. We will strive to enable [permissionless innovation](https://permissionlessinnovation.org/) wherever possible. Hellō has no position on any topic outside the scope of its mission.

## 3. For the Members, by the Members
We operate in the best interest of our members. Hellō is a multi-stakeholder cooperative with three membership classes. Every user is a user member, any organization may join as a corporate member, and all employees are employee members. We will not prioritize the interests of one membership class to the detriment of any other membership class. 
We will choose to pursue opportunities that are complimentary vs competitive to our corporate members.
For details on the cooperative structure see “[The Hellō Cooperative](cooperative.md)”.

## 4. Rough Consensus and Running Code
Borrowing from the IETF’s decision-making process, we don't let a single individual dictate decisions, nor should decisions be made by a vote, nor do we want decisions to be made in a vacuum without practical experience. Instead, we strive to make our decisions by the consent of all participants, though allowing for some dissent (rough consensus), and to have the actual products of engineering (running code) trump theoretical designs. Read (RFC 7282)[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7282.txt] for more details.

## 5. Be Transparent
When not in conflict with one of the other tenets, we will choose to make information public rather than private. Making our tenets public here is an example of this tenet.
